title: "XR-MultiAgent - The first system to explore collaborative agentic spatial intelligence in XR world"
publishedAt: "2025-11-09"
summary: "A real-time XR spatial intelligence system that integrates natural language command input 
with a multi-agent backend using FastAPI and LangGraph for agentic collaborative spatial reasoning, 
enabling dynamic, spatially coordinated XR interactions with scene objects, demonstrating scalable 
multi-modal input workflows and immersive interface behaviors (work aiming for IEEE VR 2027)."
